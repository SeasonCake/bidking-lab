"""Joint posterior over multiple quality buckets.

The per-bucket :func:`candidates_for_bucket` enumerator is locally correct
but globally myopic: when ``top_k_for_session`` solves quality 6 first and
greedily subtracts its top-1 cells from the warehouse budget, a slightly
wrong q=6 pick cascades into wrong q=5 and q=4 picks.

This module instead does a *joint* DFS over the cartesian product of
per-bucket top-N candidates, prunes on the running warehouse-cells sum,
and ranks the surviving global hypotheses by summed composite score plus
a soft penalty for exceeding the observed warehouse capacity.

Typical session size: 3-5 observed quality buckets × 8 top-N candidates
each = at most 8^5 = 32_768 combinations, with aggressive cells-sum
pruning the actual explored count is usually < 1_000 per call → sub-ms
runtime on a laptop. No need for fancy MCMC or LP relaxations.
